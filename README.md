Github repository of code used during my URP project at CSHL titled, "Investigating the effects of PPARd GOF in macrophages on anti-tumour immunity".

The repository is divided into the various techniques used and all data, code and graphs are stored here:
1. LysM-Cre contains the scRNA-seq analysis (in R) of the LysM-Cre VP16-PPARd data.
2. LysM-Cre DATA contains the LysM-Cre VP16-PPARd data
3. Immunofluorescence contains the CD4 T cell panel data (from LysM-Cre tumours) and the Fiji and QuPath files used to edit the images. The excel sheet storing image area for normalisation is also present.
4. Flow contains the MHC flow cytometry data and the FlowJo and Prism files used to analyse the data.
5. Human scRNA-seq contains Chen_hepatocyte data (which i performed scRNA-seq on preliminarily but didn't use) and Haoyu colorectal data, which I used for PPARd-MHC correlation analysis.
6. qpCR_RNA_quantification.xslx contains the RNA quantity used to make cDNA for qPCR (which we didn't use).
7. bulk_rna_seq was an attempt to perform bulk RNA-seq analysis on PPARd agonist-treated human data.
